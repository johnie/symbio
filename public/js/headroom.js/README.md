#Headroom.js

##What does it do?

Give your pages some headroom. Hide your header until you need it.

##Why does it do it?

Fixed headers are great because the main navigation is always at hand. However, there are some problems with fixed headers...

Large screens often have a width greater than height, meaning your vertical space is valuable real estate. On smaller screens, height *is* typically greater than width, but because of the overall size of the screen a meaningfully sized header will still be quite imposing.

##However...

This is a work in progress, a first cut if you will. It's definitely functional, but there's a few niggles I wish to resolve before declaring it production-worthy.
